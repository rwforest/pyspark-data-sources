## Introduction

When we set out to migrate the popular `spark-datasource-rest` library from Scala to Python, we thought it would be straightforward. After all, both are Spark data sources, right? What we discovered was a fascinating journey through two fundamentally different API architectures, each with its own philosophy, constraints, and capabilities.

This is the story of that migration, the unexpected challenges we faced, and the valuable lessons learned about PySpark 4.0's Data Source API.

## The Original: A Scala Success Story

The `spark-datasource-rest` library has been helping data scientists call REST APIs at scale since the Spark 2.x era. Its premise is elegant:

```scala
// Create input parameters
val sodaDf = Seq(
  ("Nevada", "nn"),
  ("Northern California", "pr")
).toDF("region", "source")

sodaDf.createOrReplaceTempView("sodainputtbl")

// Call REST API in parallel for each row
val resultDf = spark.read.format("rest")
  .option("url", "https://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/6yvf-kk3n.json")
  .option("input", "sodainputtbl")
  .option("method", "GET")
  .load()
```

Simple, powerful, and battle-tested in production. Our goal was to bring this capability to the Python ecosystem.

## The Migration: First Steps

Armed with the Scala source code and PySpark 4.0's new Data Source API, we began the migration. The structure seemed straightforward:

**Scala Architecture:**
```scala
class RestDataSource extends RelationProvider {
  override def createRelation(
    sqlContext: SQLContext,
    parameters: Map[String, String]): BaseRelation = {
    RESTRelation(restOptions)(sqlContext.sparkSession)
  }
}
```

**Python Translation:**
```python
class RestDataSource(DataSource):
    @classmethod
    def name(cls) -> str:
        return "rest"

    def reader(self, schema: StructType) -> DataSourceReader:
        return RestReader(self.options, schema)
```

We implemented all the features:
- ✅ HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ Authentication (Basic, OAuth1, Bearer tokens)
- ✅ Schema inference from JSON responses
- ✅ Parallel execution across partitions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

The code looked great. Tests passed locally. We built the wheel, wrote documentation, and felt ready to ship.

Then came Databricks.

## The First Crisis: Empty Outputs

```python
# User's code in Databricks
post_df.createOrReplaceTempView("posts_to_create")

result_df = spark.read.format("rest") \
    .option("url", "https://api.example.com/posts") \
    .option("input", "posts_to_create") \
    .option("method", "POST") \
    .load()

result_df.show()  # Empty! No data!
```

The data source returned zero rows in Databricks, despite working perfectly in local mode. The investigation began.

### Debug Attempt #1: Check the Logs

Deep in the Spark logs, we found:

```
Error in RestReader.read: No active Spark session found
```

The data source was trying to read the input table using:

```python
def partitions(self):
    spark = SparkSession.getActiveSession()
    if spark is None:
        raise RuntimeError("No active Spark session found")

    input_df = spark.sql(f"SELECT * FROM {self.input_table}")
    ...
```

`SparkSession.getActiveSession()` was returning `None` in Databricks!

### The Hypothesis: Execution Context

We theorized this was an executor vs. driver issue. The `partitions()` method must be running on executors without access to the driver's session.

We tested:

```python
def test_session_access():
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    # In driver code
    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    print(f"Driver: {spark}")  # Works

    # In executor task
    def executor_task(x):
        session = SparkSession.getActiveSession()
        print(f"Executor: {session}")  # None!
        return x

    spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1]).map(executor_task).collect()
```

**Result:** Even in executors, `getActiveSession()` returned `None`. But wait - the `partitions()` method runs on the driver, not executors!

We tested further:

```python
class TestDataSource(DataSource):
    def schema(self):
        spark = SparkSession.getActiveSession()
        print(f"In schema(): {spark}")  # None!
        return "id INT"

    def reader(self, schema):
        return TestReader()

class TestReader(DataSourceReader):
    def __init__(self):
        spark = SparkSession.getActiveSession()
        print(f"In __init__: {spark}")  # None!

    def partitions(self):
        spark = SparkSession.getActiveSession()
        print(f"In partitions(): {spark}")  # None!
        return [InputPartition(0)]
```

**Revelation:** `SparkSession.getActiveSession()` returns `None` in **ALL** data source methods, even those running on the driver!

This wasn't about executors. This was about the API itself.

## The Investigation: Comparing APIs

We dove into the Spark documentation and examined working data sources in the project. A pattern emerged:

**Working data sources (JSONPlaceholder, Robinhood, etc.):**
- ✅ Read from external APIs with fixed parameters
- ✅ Use options to configure endpoints
- ❌ Do NOT read from other Spark tables
- ❌ Do NOT access SparkSession

**Our REST data source:**
- ❌ Tried to read from Spark temporary tables
- ❌ Required SparkSession access
- ❌ Fundamentally different pattern

Then we looked at the Scala source code more carefully. Line 67-68 of `RestRelation.scala`:

```scala
private val inputDf = if (restOptions.inputType == "tableName") {
      sparkSession.sql(s"select * from $inputs")  // How does this work?
}
```

How does the Scala version have `sparkSession`? We traced it back to line 40:

```scala
case class RESTRelation(
    restOptions: RESTOptions)(@transient val sparkSession: SparkSession)
```

And where does that come from? Line 42 of `RestDataSource.scala`:

```scala
override def createRelation(
    sqlContext: SQLContext,  // ← Provided by Spark!
    parameters: Map[String, String]): BaseRelation = {

  RESTRelation(restOptions)(sqlContext.sparkSession)
}
```

**The smoking gun:** Scala's `RelationProvider` API receives `SQLContext` as a parameter. Python's `DataSource` API does not.

### API Architecture Comparison

| Feature | Scala RelationProvider | Python DataSource |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| **API Version** | Spark 2.x Data Source V2 | PySpark 4.0+ |
| **Session Access** | ✅ Injected via `createRelation(sqlContext, ...)` | ❌ No injection mechanism |
| **Can Read Tables** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Design Philosophy** | Tight Catalyst integration | Security & isolation |
| **Use Case** | Complex data operations | External data sources |

The Python Data Source API was **intentionally designed** not to provide session access. This wasn't a bug - it was a feature!

## The Solution Journey

### Attempt #1: TaskContext

We explored using `TaskContext` to access Spark internals:

```python
from pyspark import TaskContext

def partitions(self):
    context = TaskContext.get()
    partition_id = context.partitionId()  # Works
    # But no session access!
```

`TaskContext` provides partition/stage info but no session. **Dead end.**

### Attempt #2: CSV Files

Perhaps we could write the input to a temporary CSV file?

```python
def rest_api_call_csv(input_df, url, method, **options):
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    # Write to CSV
    input_df.write.csv(temp_dir)

    # Pass CSV path to data source
    result_df = spark.read.format("rest") \
        .option("inputCsvPath", csv_path) \
        .load()
```

This solved the session access problem - CSV files can be read without a session! But it hit a different wall: **schema mismatch**.

The data source returns a hardcoded schema:

```python
def schema(self) -> str:
    return "output STRING"  # 1 column
```

But actual data with `includeInputsInOutput='Y'` has:
```
title, body, userId, output  # 4 columns!
```

**Result:** Same error, different cause. The CSV approach didn't solve the fundamental problem.

### Attempt #3: The inputData Option

What if we pre-serialize the data and pass it through options?

```python
import json

# Collect and serialize on driver
input_data = [row.asDict() for row in input_df.collect()]
serialized = json.dumps(input_data)

# Pass to data source
result_df = spark.read.format("rest") \
    .option("inputData", serialized) \
    .option("url", url) \
    .load()
```

This worked! The data source could parse JSON without needing a session. But we still hit the schema mismatch when trying to include input columns.

### The Breakthrough: Helper Function

The solution was to step back and recognize what the API was telling us: **don't fight the design, work with it.**

```python
def rest_api_call(input_df, url, method, **options):
    """
    Call REST API for each row - works with the API's design
    """
    spark = SparkSession.getActiveSession()

    # 1. Collect input (we have session here!)
    input_rows = input_df.collect()
    input_data = [row.asDict() for row in input_rows]

    # 2. Serialize and pass to data source
    serialized = json.dumps(input_data)
    api_results = spark.read.format("rest") \
        .option("inputData", serialized) \
        .option("includeInputsInOutput", "N") \
        .load().collect()

    # 3. Combine in memory (preserves order)
    combined = [
        {**input_row.asDict(), 'output': output_row['output']}
        for input_row, output_row in zip(input_rows, api_results)
    ]

    # 4. Return DataFrame
    return spark.createDataFrame(combined)
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ DataFrame operations happen outside the data source (where session IS available)
- ✅ Data source does what it's good at (making API calls)
- ✅ No schema mismatch (we control the final schema)
- ✅ Works with the API's design philosophy

## The Second Crisis: Row Count Mismatch

Just when we thought we had it solved, Databricks users reported:

```
Input: 2 rows
Output: 1 row  # Where did the other row go?!
```

The helper function was using `monotonically_increasing_id()` to join input and output:

```python
input_with_id = input_df.withColumn("_id", monotonically_increasing_id())
result_with_id = result_df.withColumn("_id", monotonically_increasing_id())
final = input_with_id.join(result_with_id, "_id")
```

### The ID Generation Problem

`monotonically_increasing_id()` generates IDs based on partition distribution:

**Local mode:**
```
Input IDs:  [0, 1, 2, 3]
Output IDs: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Join: Perfect match! ✅
```

**Databricks (2 partitions):**
```
Input IDs:  [0, 8589934592, 17179869184]  # Partition-based
Output IDs: [0, 1, 2]                      # Different distribution
Join: Only ID 0 matches! ❌
```

### The Fix: In-Memory Join

The solution was simple - since we're collecting anyway, do the join in memory:

```python
# Collect both
input_rows = input_df.collect()
api_results = api_results_df.collect()

# Join with zip (preserves order)
combined = [
    {**input_row.asDict(), 'output': output_row['output']}
    for input_row, output_row in zip(input_rows, api_results)
]

return spark.createDataFrame(combined)
```

**Result:** Works perfectly in both local and Databricks! ✅

## Lessons Learned

### 1. API Philosophy Matters

The Python Data Source API isn't a direct translation of Scala's API - it has a different philosophy:

**Scala's RelationProvider:**
- Designed for tight Catalyst integration
- Full access to Spark internals
- Complex operations encouraged

**Python's DataSource:**
- Designed for security and isolation
- Limited context access
- Self-contained sources preferred

### 2. Work With the Design, Not Against It

Our initial approach tried to replicate Scala's pattern exactly. The working solution embraced Python's constraints:

```python
# ❌ Fighting the API
class RestDataSource(DataSource):
    def reader(self, schema):
        # Try to access session
        # Try to read tables
        # Fight with schema inference
        ...

# ✅ Working with the API
def rest_api_call(input_df, url, **options):
    # Use session where it's available (driver)
    # Pass data to source (not table names)
    # Handle joins outside the source
    ...
```

### 3. Test in Production-Like Environments Early

Our local tests passed perfectly. The issues only appeared in Databricks. **Lesson:** Test distributed behavior early, not just happy-path local execution.

### 4. Distributed Patterns Aren't Always Obvious

The `monotonically_increasing_id()` issue was subtle - it worked locally and seemed correct. **Lesson:** Understanding distributed ID generation, partition distribution, and execution contexts is crucial.

### 5. Documentation Is Architecture

Writing 20+ documentation files wasn't just for users - it forced us to understand the architecture deeply. Each "why doesn't this work?" led to better understanding.

## The Final Architecture

Our solution consists of three layers:

### Layer 1: Core Data Source
```python
class RestDataSource(DataSource):
    """Handles API calls, supports inputData option"""
    def reader(self, schema):
        return RestReader(self.options, schema)

class RestReader(DataSourceReader):
    """Reads from serialized JSON, makes API calls"""
    def partitions(self):
        # Load from inputData (JSON string)
        data = json.loads(self.input_data_json)
        # Create partitions
        ...

    def read(self, partition):
        # Make API calls
        # Return results
        ...
```

### Layer 2: Helper Function
```python
def rest_api_call(input_df, url, method, **options):
    """User-friendly wrapper - handles everything"""
    # Collect input
    # Serialize data
    # Call data source
    # Combine results
    # Return DataFrame
```

### Layer 3: Direct Usage (Advanced)
```python
# For users who want more control
input_data = json.dumps([row.asDict() for row in df.collect()])

result = spark.read.format("rest") \
    .option("inputData", input_data) \
    .option("url", url) \
    .load()
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Enrichment
```python
from pyspark_datasources import rest_api_call

# Customer data
customers = spark.table("customers")

# Enrich with external API
enriched = rest_api_call(
    customers,
    url="https://api.clearbit.com/v2/companies/find",
    method="GET",
    authType="Bearer",
    oauthToken="your-api-key"
)

enriched.write.saveAsTable("enriched_customers")
```

### Address Validation
```python
# Addresses to validate
addresses_df = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("123 Main St", "San Francisco", "CA", "94102"),
    ("456 Oak Ave", "New York", "NY", "10001")
], ["street", "city", "state", "zip"])

# Validate via API
validated = rest_api_call(
    addresses_df,
    url="https://api.usps.com/validate",
    method="POST",
    userId="api-user",
    userPassword="api-pass"
)

validated.show()
```

### Batch API Calls
```python
# Process 10,000 rows in parallel
large_df = spark.table("large_dataset")  # 10,000 rows

results = rest_api_call(
    large_df,
    url="https://api.example.com/process",
    method="POST",
    partitions="50"  # 50 parallel API calls
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Dataset Size Recommendations

| Rows | Recommendation | Reason |
|------|---------------|---------|
| < 1,000 | ✅ Perfect fit | Minimal memory overhead |
| 1K - 10K | ✅ Good | Acceptable driver memory |
| 10K - 100K | ⚠️ Caution | Monitor driver memory |
| > 100K | ❌ Consider alternatives | UDF or batch processing |

### Why Collection Is Acceptable

The data source is designed for **API enrichment**, not bulk processing:

1. **API calls are the bottleneck** - Network I/O dominates
2. **Typical use cases** - Enriching datasets with external data
3. **Parallelism still works** - API calls are parallelized
4. **Simple is better** - Easier to debug and maintain

For truly large datasets, consider:
- Batch processing (10K rows at a time)
- UDF-based approach (fully distributed)
- Streaming with rate limiting

## Key Takeaways

### For Developers Migrating Scala to Python

1. **APIs are not equivalent** - Scala's Data Source V2 and Python's Data Source API have different capabilities
2. **Session access patterns differ** - What works in Scala may be impossible in Python
3. **Embrace the constraints** - Work with Python's design, don't fight it
4. **Test distributed early** - Local tests hide many issues
5. **Helper functions are OK** - They're not workarounds, they're correct solutions

### For Users of the Library

1. **Use `rest_api_call()`** - It's the recommended, tested approach
2. **Understand the limits** - Best for < 10K rows
3. **Monitor memory** - Collection happens on driver
4. **Databricks works great** - Just use the helper function
5. **Read the docs** - 21 guides cover every scenario

### For the Spark Community

1. **Python API is restrictive by design** - Security and isolation trump convenience
2. **Documentation matters** - Clear guidance on what's supported vs. not
3. **Helper patterns are valid** - Not every feature needs pure data source API
4. **Migration isn't translation** - Different languages need different approaches

## Conclusion

Migrating `spark-datasource-rest` from Scala to Python taught us that APIs aren't just about syntax - they embody philosophy, design decisions, and trade-offs.

The Scala version works beautifully within its API's capabilities. The Python version works equally well within *its* API's constraints. Neither is better or worse - they're different tools for different contexts.

Our final solution embraces this reality: a data source for what it's good at (making API calls), wrapped in helper functions for what users need (DataFrame enrichment). Clean, tested, and production-ready.

The journey was challenging, but the result is a robust library that serves Python users well while respecting PySpark's architectural decisions.
